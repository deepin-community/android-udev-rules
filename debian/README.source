This package follows the dgit-maint-debrebase(7) workflow.

The package also follows DEP-14, so you'll find what you'd expect in the
debian/latest and upstream/latest branches.

New upstream releases are fetched from the upstream git repository from
the "upstreamvcs" remote.

As upstream does not use tarballs, a pristine-tar branch is not maintained.
